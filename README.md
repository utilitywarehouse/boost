# UW Boost
Welcome to the UW Boost guide, or how to get jump started with technology at UW. Below are a collection of resources that will be useful to work on our tech stack.  This is intended for people new to these technologies as well as anyone with experience looking for a bit of a cheat sheet.

99% of all our services are written in Go, while the frontend is React, glued together with GraphQL.  At the moment this guide will focus on the two most important aspects for the majority of our developers Go and K8s.

## Our Stack
**Infrastructure**
- K8s (Kubernets)
- Terraform
- AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
- On Prem

**The Backend**
 - Go (GoLang)

**The Frontend**
- React
- Typescript
- GraphQL

## Go
For those that cherish the classroom experience Udemy has a great course that covers a range from fundamentals all the way to advanced language features. This is probably the best place to start for most people.  
- [Learn how to code](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/)

For people that prefer the rustle of paper and self directed learning then the best place to start is *the* Go book
- [The Go Programming Language](http://www.gopl.io/)

Finally for the hybrid person who wants self directed learning with an  interactive element, Exercism has a good Go track.  This is also a great way to learn how tests are written in Go as each exercise comes with the tests, for which you need to write code that passes them.
